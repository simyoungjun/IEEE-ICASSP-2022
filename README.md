# SPCUP2022: Speech Spoof Detection Challenge

The **SPCUP2022 Speech Spoof Detection Challenge**, part of the IEEE Signal Processing Cup, focused on **Synthetic Speech Attribution**. Participants were tasked with identifying the specific synthesis method used to generate a given synthetic speech recording, a critical step in ensuring the security of speech-related technologies.

## üîç Challenge Overview

The challenge aimed to develop systems capable of distinguishing between various speech synthesis methods, including:
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** techniques.
- **Voice Conversion (VC)** methods.

Participants were provided with audio recordings generated using multiple synthesis methods. The evaluation focused on the system's ability to correctly classify the synthesis technique, particularly in challenging, perturbed conditions.
