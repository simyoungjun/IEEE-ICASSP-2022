# SPCUP2022: Speech Spoof Detection Challenge

The **SPCUP2022 Speech Spoof Detection Challenge**, part of the IEEE Signal Processing Cup, focused on **Synthetic Speech Attribution**. Participants were tasked with designing systems capable of identifying the specific synthesis method used to generate synthetic speech. The challenge also involved detecting speech generated by unknown synthesis algorithms, a critical task in ensuring the robustness of speech-based technologies.

## üîç Challenge Overview

The primary objective of this challenge was to classify synthetic speech into:
1. Known algorithms (e.g., Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2).
2. Unknown algorithms, requiring systems to generalize beyond the training data.

The figure below illustrates the problem setup, where a system receives an input audio waveform and predicts the synthesis method or detects it as an unknown source:
